# npm-search MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server that allows you to search for npm packages by calling the `npm search` command.

### Available Tools

- `search_npm_packages` - Search for npm packages.
  - Required arguments:
    - `query` (string): The search query.

## Installation

### Using NPM (recommended)

Alternatively you can install `npm-search-mcp-server` via npm:

```bash
npm install -g npm-search-mcp-server
```

After installation, you can run it as a command using:

```bash
npm-search-mcp-server
```

### Using uv

When using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) no specific installation is needed. We will
use [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/) to directly run *npm-search-mcp-server*.

```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```bash
cd path/to/servers/src/npm-search
